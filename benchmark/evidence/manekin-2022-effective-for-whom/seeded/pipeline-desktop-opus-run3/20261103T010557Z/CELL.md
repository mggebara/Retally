## Notes

- answer-1.md: reply to prompt-1.txt from the LLM oracle store desktop-opus-run3 (request 20fea0aa18ef96f6cfb4f574: model claude-opus-5-5, max_tokens 16384, effort high)
- usage records 4 model calls; 1 are code-generation prompts kept above, the other 3 (paper extraction) leave no prompt in the artifacts
